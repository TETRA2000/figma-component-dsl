# Research & Design Decisions

## Summary
- **Feature**: `claude-desktop-interactive-workflow`
- **Discovery Scope**: New Feature (greenfield skills + preview infrastructure + validation packages + Figma auto-publish)
- **Key Findings**:
  - Figma MCP server's `generate_figma_design` tool enables auto-publishing designs to Figma files directly from Claude Desktop — eliminates manual plugin import
  - Existing DSL pipeline already accumulates `CompileError[]` with node path tracking; a new `@figma-dsl/validator` package can extend this with React-to-DSL structural validation
  - `vite-plugin-singlefile` (86K weekly downloads) solves HTML export by inlining all CSS/JS into a single file
  - Figma REST API is read-only for file contents; only the Figma MCP server and Plugin API can create/modify designs

## Research Log

### Claude AI Skills SKILL.md Format
- **Context**: Need to understand exact frontmatter spec for skills
- **Sources**: [Claude Code Skills Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills), [Anthropic Skills Repo](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)
- **Findings**:
  - Allowed frontmatter keys: `name`, `description`, `license`, `allowed-tools`, `metadata`, `compatibility`
  - `allowed-tools` grants tool access without per-use approval (CLI only, not SDK)
  - `description` field is the primary mechanism for auto-invocation — Claude matches user requests against descriptions
  - Skills support `$ARGUMENTS` and `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` string substitution
  - Supporting files go under subdirectories (`references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`)
- **Implications**: Skills need descriptive `description` fields with trigger phrases. `allowed-tools` should include `Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`.

### `.claude/launch.json` Preview Configuration
- **Context**: Need exact format for preview server configs
- **Sources**: [Claude Code Desktop Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/desktop)
- **Findings**:
  - Format: `{ version, autoVerify, configurations: [{ name, runtimeExecutable, runtimeArgs, port, cwd, env, autoPort }] }`
  - Supports multiple concurrent configurations (e.g., frontend + API)
  - `autoVerify: true` (default) makes Claude take screenshots after edits to verify changes
  - `cwd` supports `${workspaceFolder}` variable
  - `autoPort: true` finds free port automatically if preferred port is in use
- **Implications**: Two configs needed — Vite dev server (port 5173) and static file server for PNG previews.

### HTML Export Strategy — Vite Build + Single File
- **Context**: Requirement 5 needs self-contained HTML from React components
- **Sources**: [vite-plugin-singlefile](https://github.com/richardtallent/vite-plugin-singlefile), [Vite Build Docs](https://vite.dev/guide/build)
- **Findings**:
  - `vite-plugin-singlefile` inlines all JS+CSS into `dist/index.html` — 86K weekly downloads, mature
  - CSS Modules are handled natively by Vite's build pipeline
  - Design tokens (`tokens.css`) imported as global CSS are automatically bundled
  - No custom SSR needed — standard Vite build with single-file plugin produces a complete, self-contained page
- **Implications**: HTML export skill uses Vite build pipeline. No custom `packages/html-renderer` needed.

### Figma MCP Server — Auto-Publishing to Figma
- **Context**: User requested automatic publishing of designs to Figma, eliminating manual plugin import
- **Sources**: [Figma MCP Server Docs](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/), [Figma MCP Tools](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/tools-and-prompts/), [Figma REST API](https://developers.figma.com/docs/rest-api/)
- **Findings**:
  - **`generate_figma_design`** (write): Sends live UI as design layers to new or existing Figma files. Remote server only. Exempt from standard rate limits. Requires edit permissions for existing files. New files created in team/organization drafts.
  - **`add_code_connect_map`** (write): Establishes mappings between Figma design nodes and code components. Figma Design files only.
  - **`send_code_connect_mappings`** (write): Confirms Code Connect mappings after `get_code_connect_suggestions` detection.
  - **`get_code_connect_suggestions`** (read): Detects and suggests Code Connect mappings from codebase.
  - **`get_design_context`** (read): Returns design context for a layer/selection. Default output is React + Tailwind, customizable to other frameworks.
  - **`get_variable_defs`** (read): Returns variables and styles (colors, spacing, typography) from Figma selection.
  - **`get_screenshot`** (read): Captures visual representations of selections.
  - **Authentication**: Figma MCP server handles auth internally when configured in Claude Desktop — users authenticate via Figma's OAuth flow.
  - **Figma REST API limitation**: REST API is read-only for file contents — cannot create files or components. Only Plugin API and MCP server can write.
- **Implications**:
  - The Figma Export Skill can auto-publish designs via MCP's `generate_figma_design` instead of manual plugin JSON import
  - Code Connect mappings can be auto-established via `add_code_connect_map` after design is published
  - The existing exporter JSON format (PluginInput) is still useful for the Figma plugin fallback path
  - MCP server must be configured in Claude Desktop's MCP settings — skill should document setup instructions
  - Two publishing paths: (1) MCP server direct publish (preferred), (2) plugin JSON import (fallback)

### Figma REST API — Read-Only Limitation
- **Context**: Investigated whether REST API could create/modify Figma files
- **Sources**: [Figma REST API Introduction](https://developers.figma.com/docs/rest-api/), [Figma API Comparison](https://developers.figma.com/compare-apis/)
- **Findings**:
  - REST API is for reading/extracting design data, not creating
  - `createComponent` exists only in the Plugin API (runs inside Figma editor)
  - 2025 platform changes introduced granular scopes (`file_content:read`, `file_metadata:read`) replacing broad `file_read`
  - No REST endpoint for creating components, frames, or files programmatically
- **Implications**: MCP server `generate_figma_design` is the only external-to-Figma write path. Plugin JSON import remains as fallback.

### DSL Compatibility Validation — Existing Pipeline Analysis
- **Context**: User requested validation for React components to ensure DSL compatibility, enabling AI iteration
- **Sources**: Codebase analysis of `packages/dsl-core`, `packages/compiler`, `packages/exporter`
- **Findings**:
  - **Existing validation** is minimal:
    - `dsl-core/src/nodes.ts`: Name validation (non-empty), text validation (non-empty characters), instance validation (non-empty componentRef)
    - `dsl-core/src/colors.ts`: Hex color pattern validation (`/^#?([0-9a-fA-F]{6})$/`), token existence check
    - `compiler/src/compiler.ts`: Accumulates `CompileError[]` with `{ message, nodePath, nodeType }`
    - `renderer/src/renderer.ts`: `RenderError` class with `nodePath` and `nodeType`
  - **DSL node types** (`DslNode` in `dsl-core/src/types.ts`):
    - `NodeType = 'FRAME' | 'TEXT' | 'RECTANGLE' | 'ELLIPSE' | 'GROUP' | 'COMPONENT' | 'COMPONENT_SET' | 'INSTANCE'`
    - Components have `componentProperties: ComponentProperty[]` (type: `TEXT | BOOLEAN | INSTANCE_SWAP`)
    - Auto-layout: direction, padding, spacing, alignment, sizing modes (`FIXED | HUG | FILL`)
  - **Compiler input format** (`.dsl.ts` files):
    - Import DSL factory functions from `@figma-dsl/core`
    - Export default `DslNode` (NOT React components)
    - Build tree using `frame()`, `text()`, `rectangle()`, `component()`, etc.
    - CLI loads via dynamic import and validates `mod.default` exists
  - **Exporter output** (`PluginInput`): `{ schemaVersion: "1.0.0", targetPage, components: PluginNodeDef[] }`
  - **No schema validation library** — relies on TypeScript type system only
- **Implications**:
  - A new `@figma-dsl/validator` package can provide programmatic validation of React component structure against DSL constraints
  - Validation rules: CSS Modules usage, design token references, prop interface patterns, className composition pattern
  - The validator runs as a CLI command (`figma-dsl validate`) and as a programmatic API for skill-driven iteration
  - Compiler errors (`CompileError[]`) already provide the reporting pattern — validator should follow the same interface
  - React components are NOT `.dsl.ts` files — the validator bridges the gap by checking if a React component can be faithfully represented as DSL nodes

### Figma Export Validation
- **Context**: User asked whether validation of Figma export output is needed
- **Sources**: Codebase analysis of `packages/exporter`
- **Findings**:
  - Exporter produces `PluginInput` JSON — the schema is well-defined (`PluginNodeDef` with typed fields)
  - The Figma plugin (`packages/plugin`) consumes this JSON and uses `figma.createComponent()` — errors surface there
  - MCP `generate_figma_design` accepts design layers, not raw JSON — validation is at the design-layer level
  - Compile errors are already reported by the compiler; exporter transforms compile output deterministically
- **Implications**:
  - Exporter validation is less critical since it's a deterministic transform of compiler output
  - Compile-time validation (`@figma-dsl/validator`) catches issues before they reach the exporter
  - MCP path validation happens at the Figma server side — errors returned to Claude for iteration
  - Recommend: Focus validation effort on the React→DSL compatibility gap (validator package), not on exporter output

## Architecture Pattern Evaluation

| Option | Description | Strengths | Risks / Limitations | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Skills as Pure Docs | SKILL.md instructs Claude, no tooling | Low complexity | No programmatic validation, inconsistent outputs | v1 approach |
| Skills + Validator Package | Add `@figma-dsl/validator` for React→DSL checks | Deterministic validation, AI iteration loop | New package to maintain | Selected approach |
| Skills + Full Package Suite | Add validator + html-renderer + token-resolver | Maximum determinism | Over-engineering for skill workflow | Rejected — Vite handles HTML/tokens |

**Selected**: Skills + Validator Package + Figma MCP. Skills provide workflow documentation, `@figma-dsl/validator` enables programmatic React→DSL compatibility checks, Figma MCP server handles auto-publishing.

## Design Decisions

### Decision: Preview App as Vite Scaffold at `preview/`
- **Context**: Skills need a writable directory with Vite+React for preview rendering
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. `packages/preview-app/` — monorepo package
  2. `preview/` — standalone directory at repo root
  3. User's own project directory — write into arbitrary locations
- **Selected Approach**: `preview/` at repo root with Vite config that aliases reference components
- **Rationale**: Not a publishable package. Keeps skill output isolated. Simple `cwd` in launch.json.
- **Trade-offs**: Extra directory, but clearly separated from source packages
- **Follow-up**: Verify Vite hot-reload for dynamically added files

### Decision: HTML Export via Vite Build + Single File Plugin
- **Context**: Requirement 5 needs self-contained HTML output
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Custom SSR with `react-dom/server` + CSS extraction
  2. Vite build + `vite-plugin-singlefile`
  3. Claude-constructed HTML from scratch
- **Selected Approach**: Vite build with `vite-plugin-singlefile`
- **Rationale**: Vite handles CSS Modules, design tokens, and asset bundling natively. No custom SSR code to maintain.
- **Trade-offs**: Requires preview app scaffold; build step takes a few seconds
- **Follow-up**: Test with lucide-react icons (SVG inlining)

### Decision: Figma Auto-Publishing via MCP Server
- **Context**: User requested automatic design publishing to Figma without manual plugin import
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Figma REST API — read-only, cannot create files
  2. Figma Plugin API — requires running inside Figma editor
  3. Figma MCP server `generate_figma_design` — remote write to Figma from Claude Desktop
- **Selected Approach**: Primary path: MCP `generate_figma_design` for direct Figma publishing. Fallback: plugin JSON import via existing exporter pipeline.
- **Rationale**: MCP server is the only external write path to Figma. No server-side code needed — Claude Desktop handles MCP communication. Exempt from rate limits.
- **Trade-offs**: Requires Figma MCP server configured in Claude Desktop; remote-only (not local MCP). Fallback plugin path covers cases where MCP is unavailable.
- **Follow-up**: Document MCP server setup in skill instructions. Test `generate_figma_design` with component hierarchies.

### Decision: New `@figma-dsl/validator` Package for DSL Compatibility
- **Context**: User requested validation enabling AI-driven iteration — Claude creates component, validates, fixes, repeats until valid
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Validation logic embedded in SKILL.md instructions — Claude checks manually
  2. Extend existing compiler with pre-compilation checks
  3. New standalone validator package with CLI command
- **Selected Approach**: New `@figma-dsl/validator` package with both programmatic API and CLI command (`figma-dsl validate`)
- **Rationale**: Separates validation concerns from compilation. Enables programmatic validation in skill iteration loops. Follows existing monorepo pattern (`packages/validator`). CLI integration means skills can run `figma-dsl validate <file>` and parse structured output.
- **Trade-offs**: New package to maintain. But validation logic is distinct from compilation and benefits from isolation.
- **Follow-up**: Define validation rule set. Determine if rules are configurable or fixed.

### Decision: Reference Components via Vite Alias
- **Context**: Skills need access to the 16 reference components
- **Selected Approach**: Vite `resolve.alias` — `@/components` resolves to reference app's `src/components/`
- **Rationale**: Avoids duplication, reference stays canonical

### Decision: Component Registry as Shared Markdown Reference
- **Context**: Requirement 6 needs a component catalog accessible to all skills
- **Selected Approach**: Markdown reference document under `.claude/skills/shared/references/component-registry.md`
- **Rationale**: Skills read markdown references naturally. No build step. Human-readable.
- **Trade-offs**: Manual maintenance (Component Creation Skill updates it per 6.5)

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Figma MCP server is remote-only and may not be configured in all Claude Desktop environments → Mitigation: Plugin JSON import as fallback; skill documents both paths
- **Risk**: `generate_figma_design` input format may not map 1:1 to existing exporter JSON → Mitigation: Skill instructs Claude to use preview app's rendered output for MCP publishing (not raw JSON)
- **Risk**: Validator rules may be too strict/loose for AI iteration → Mitigation: Start with core rules (CSS Modules, tokens, prop patterns); extend based on usage feedback
- **Risk**: Vite hot-reload may not pick up newly added files → Mitigation: Skill instructs Claude to restart dev server if needed
- **Risk**: Code Connect requires valid FIGMA_URL that doesn't exist pre-publish → Mitigation: MCP's `add_code_connect_map` establishes mappings after design is published
- **Risk**: Design token CSS custom properties may not resolve identically across DSL and React → Mitigation: Token reference provides mapping table; validator checks token references
